## Presentation

Hello — my name is Sebastián Adrián Crăciun.

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker passionate about understanding how systems work (and where they fail).

I specialize in offensive security, vulnerability research, and designing secure architectures from a practical perspective.

Over the past few years, I have been practicing web application pentesting, network exploitation, and proof-of-concept development.

I believe that true expertise comes from curiosity, continuous practice, and hands-on learning.

## My mission

Helping organizations strengthen their defenses by thinking like an attacker—responsibly, methodically, and ethically. I transform complex technical findings into actionable recommendations that improve security posture.


## Certifications & Learning Path

- **eWPTXv3** – INE Security (Web Application Penetration Testing eXtreme)  
- **eCPPTv2** – INE Security (Certified Professional Penetration Tester)  
- **eJPTv3** – INE Security (Junior Penetration Tester)  
- **ICCA** – INE Security (Certified Cloud Associate)  

I’m constantly exploring new methodologies and tools within both **Red Team** and **Blue Team** disciplines.

## Areas of Expertise

- Web application and API pentesting
- Network analysis and exploitation
- Vulnerability research and CVE analysis
- Scripting and automation (Python, Bash, Go)
- Cloud security (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- Threat modeling and Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

## Philosophy

Security isn’t **paranoia**:
- It is _raising awareness_.
- It is _prevention_.
- It is _ensuring safety_.

Every exploit teaches us something about the interaction between humans and machines.
Breaking systems (ethically) is a powerful way to learn how to build them better.

## Let’s Connect

If you are looking for someone who combines technical rigor with creative thinking, please contact me.
I am open to collaborations, security research, and opportunities to join professional teams.
