## 👋​ Presentation

Hey there — I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker passionate about understanding how systems *really* work (and how they fail).  

My focus is on offensive security, vulnerability research, and building secure-by-design architectures.

Over the past few years, I’ve immersed myself in penetration testing, web application security, and exploit development.

I believe that true expertise in cybersecurity comes from curiosity, continuous learning, and a hands-on approach.

## 🎯 My Mission

To help organizations strengthen their defenses by thinking like an attacker — responsibly, methodically, and ethically.  
I aim to transform complex technical findings into actionable insights that improve security posture.


## 🧠 Certifications & Learning Path

- **eWPTXv3** – INE Security (Web Application Penetration Testing eXtreme)  
- **eCPPTv2** – INE Security (Certified Professional Penetration Tester)  
- **OSCP** – Offensive Security Certified Professional  
- **CompTIA Security+** *(or other relevant certs)*  

I’m constantly exploring new methodologies and tools within both **Red Team** and **Blue Team** disciplines.


## 🧰 Areas of Expertise

- Web Application & API Penetration Testing  
- Network Security & Exploitation  
- Vulnerability Research & CVE Analysis  
- Scripting & Automation (Python, Bash, Go)  
- Cloud Security (AWS / Azure)  
- Threat Modeling & Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

## 💬 Philosophy

Security isn’t about paranoia — it’s about awareness.  
Every exploit teaches something new about how humans and machines interact.  
Breaking things (ethically) is just another way to understand how to build them better.

## 🔗 Let’s Connect

If you’re looking for someone who blends technical rigor with creative problem-solving, let’s talk.  
I’m open to collaborations, security research, and opportunities to grow within the infosec community.
